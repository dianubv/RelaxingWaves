# RelaxingWaves
A mini project was made for the MDT course to learn how to use three-js.

It's a little robot on a raft, lost in the ocean. You can increase wave intensity by pressing the space bar. The robot will recommend keeping your breathing in tune with the waves. You can also control its facial expressions. 

This project is based on [Thomas-Jld's course](https://github.com/Thomas-Jld/mdt-threejs/tree/master). The robot was modeled by [Tomás Laulhé](https://www.patreon.com/quaternius) and modified by [Don McCurdy](https://donmccurdy.com/). Link to the code [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_animation_skinning_morph.html). 

A possibility to add robot emotes *('Jump', 'Yes', 'No', 'Wave', 'Punch', 'ThumbsUp')* or states *( 'Idle', 'Walking', 'Running', 'Dance', 'Death', 'Sitting', 'Standing' )* can be implemented, but I did have enough time. Be free to use this project :)
